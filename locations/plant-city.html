                        <h3>Indoor Air Quality Enhancement</h3>
                        <p>Plant City's agricultural environment and inland location can present unique indoor air quality challenges, including seasonal pollen, agricultural dust, and allergens from farming operations. Ductless mini split systems provide superior air filtration and humidity control compared to traditional HVAC systems, creating healthier indoor environments for Plant City residents and workers.</p>

                        <p>Multi-stage filtration systems in modern ductless units capture microscopic allergens, agricultural pollutants, and airborne contaminants that can be present in farming communities.
